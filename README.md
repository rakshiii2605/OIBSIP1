## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship - Task 1**, where I developed a **Dark-Themed Online Train Reservation System** using **PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and VS Code**.

The system allows users to register, log in, book train tickets, and manage their reservations through a simple and elegant web interface.  
It aims to bring efficiency and ease to train ticket management with a modern design and secure database integration.
